After turning its focus to the automobile sector, in the 1990s MOBIS produced recreational vehicles like the Galloper and Santamo to create the \u201cGalloper Legend\u201d. \r\n\r\n1990 MOBIS redesigned itself as an auto parts specialist. \r\n\r\nHyundai Precision started to produce and supply chassis modules for Hyundai Motor and took the after-sales service parts businesses from both Hyundai and Kia motors in late 1999, and the company was renamed as MOBIS, kicking off the new millennium. 2000 was the year that MOBIS not only changed its name, but also became the biggest automotive parts company in charge of after-sales service parts distribution, auto parts export and module manufacturing. \r\n\r\nAgainst this backdrop, another adventure is awaiting MOBIS, as the company merged with Hyundai Autonet in 2009. The future technologies for automobiles need a systematic integration of both mechanical and electronic parts and MOBIS is now prepared to take on the future. \r\n\r\nAs a leader in the auto parts sector in Korea, MOBIS will take the next jump to reach the goal of becoming a \u2018Global Top 5.\u2019\r\n\r\nLooking for an Automotive Challenge in Frankfurt?  follow \r\nhttp://jobsuche.monster.de/Jobs/?q=mobis&cy=de",

The public pilot began in March 2009. Since then, car2go has been a success story, and today it is the generic name for fully flexible car-sharing models, which it pioneered. car2go, the market leader worldwide, is currently located in 30 cities, in nine countries, on three continents.
